        <p style="color: white;">Once you arrive at Seram island, the next step is getting to Saleman village and Ora beach. It takes about 2 hours to drive from Amahai to Salemen, and it’s a scenic jungle road that winds through the mountains. The road is paved all the way, although there are plenty of broken spots.Your hotel in Ora or Saleman can arrange a car and driver to pick you up in Amahai and bring you to the bay. Our guesthouse connected us with a friendly driver named Rudi, who handled our transfer to Saleman village and back. The price was around 600k Rupiah (~$40 USD) each way, although that was during Covid so the price may have gone up a bit now.Once you arrive in Saleman village, you can get to Ora beach by boat in just 10 minutes. The guesthouse where we stayed in Saleman had half day boat tours to Ora Beach Resort for 350k Rupiah per boat, or you could do a full day tour to several places in the area for 900k per boat.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">The prime place to stay in Seram used to be Ora Beach Resort, but sadly it sounds like it has gone downhill recently. This was the original hotel in Saleman,established in 1997.The bungalows at Ora Beach Resort are beautiful and so is the location, but I’ve seen some very bad reviews lately about the lack of maintenance ever since Covid happened. It sounds like the bungalows there are totally run down and falling apart.   Don’t get me wrong, you should definitely visit Ora Beach for sightseeing and snorkeling (on a day trip from Saleman), but I wouldn’t recommend staying there unless things improve. Stay at one of the places by Saleman village instead.</p>
        <p style="color: white;">The Sawai cliff is a giant white limestone cliff that can be reached in about 10 minutes by boat from Ora beach, or 20 minutes from Saleman. We visited this spot on a day tour.The water below the cliff isrelatively shallow, making it a great spot for swimming and snorkeling, and there’s a small sea cave to explore. It also has a little wooden platform and gazebo where you can sit and relax.The water here was very calm, and we were able to see lots of nice fish and corals while snorkeling, including some nemo fish hiding in the anemones!</p><button style="color: black; background-color: rgb(189, 139, 236);"> Read More</button>
